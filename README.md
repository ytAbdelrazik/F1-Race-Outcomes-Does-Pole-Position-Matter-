# F1-Race-Outcomes-Does-Pole-Position-Matter-

Project Overview

This project investigates whether starting a Formula 1 race from the pole position (the first position on the starting grid) provides a significant advantage in winning the race. By analyzing historical race data, we aim to understand the impact of starting position on race outcomes and determine if securing the pole position increases the likelihood of winning.
based on the dataset  “Formula 1 World Championship (1950 - 2024)” from kaggle,Here is the link of the dataset:

Data Collection and Preparation
The dataset consists of Formula 1 race results, including information on grid positions and final positions of drivers across multiple races.
Data is filtered to create two subsets:
Pole Position Data: Races where drivers started from the pole position (grid position = 1).
Race Winners Data: Races where drivers finished in the first position (positionOrder = 1), along with their starting grid positions.

Analysis and Visualization
Calculate the percentage of races won by drivers starting from the pole position.
Derive probabilities of winning from the pole position versus any other grid position.
Conduct a Chi-Square Test of Independence to examine the association between starting position and winning.
Visualize the results using bar plots, pie charts, and heatmaps.

Results
The analysis indicates that a significant portion of races are won by drivers starting from the pole position.
The probability of winning from the pole position is notably higher than from other positions.
The Chi-Square test results show a strong association between starting at the pole and winning the race.


Conclusion
Starting from the pole position in Formula 1 races provides drivers with a significant edge in winning. The findings highlight the strategic importance of securing the pole position for teams and drivers.
