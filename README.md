This project analyzes the impact of starting from pole position on winning Formula 1 races.

Introduction:The objective of this project is to investigate the relationship between starting a Formula 1 race from the pole position (the first position on the starting grid) and winning the race. The null hypothesis assumes that there is no association between starting from pole position and winning the race. By analyzing historical race data, we aim to determine whether starting from the pole position gives drivers a statistically significant advantage in winning races.

conclusion:The analysis shows that starting from the pole position in Formula 1 races really does give drivers a significant edge in winning. The data suggests a strong link between being on the front row and crossing the finish line first. This insight highlights the strategic importance of securing the pole position for F1 teams and drivers.
